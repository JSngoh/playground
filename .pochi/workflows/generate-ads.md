Ad Generation Workflow
When a user uploads a screenshot and requests ad variations:
Analysis Phase
• Examine the uploaded screenshot to understand:
    ◦ Overall design style (modern, classic, minimal, bold)
    ◦ Color palette used
    ◦ Typography choices
    ◦ Layout structure
    ◦ Key messaging and value propositions
    ◦ Target audience implied by the design
Generation Phase
Create 5 distinct ad variations, each with:
Variation 1: Benefit-Focused
• *Headline*: Emphasize the main benefit or value proposition
• *Description*: 2-3 sentences explaining the key advantage
• *Style*: Clean, professional layout with plenty of white space
• *Colors*: Use blues and whites for trust and clarity
Variation 2: Urgency-Driven
• *Headline*: Create sense of urgency or scarcity
• *Description*: Short, punchy text with clear call-to-action
• *Style*: Bold typography with contrasting colors
• *Colors*: Use reds and oranges for urgency
Variation 3: Question-Based
• *Headline*: Pose a compelling question to the audience
• *Description*: Answer the question with product benefits
• *Style*: Conversational, approachable design
• *Colors*: Use greens and earth tones for comfort
Variation 4: Social Proof
• *Headline*: Include testimonial or statistic
• *Description*: Highlight customer success or popularity
• *Style*: Include quote marks or star ratings visually
• *Colors*: Use purple and gold for premium feel
Variation 5: Minimalist
• *Headline*: Simple, direct message
• *Description*: Very brief, essential information only
• *Style*: Maximum white space, single focal point
• *Colors*: Monochrome with one accent color
Output Requirements
For each variation, create:
• Complete HTML file with embedded CSS
• Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
• Proper heading hierarchy and semantic markup
• Ready-to-use ad dimensions (common sizes: 1200x630, 1080x1080, 728x90)
• File naming: `ad-variation-1.html`, `ad-variation-2.html`, etc.
Quality Guidelines
• Ensure all text is readable with proper contrast
• Maintain brand consistency while exploring variations
• Include clear call-to-action buttons
• Optimize for different platforms (social media, web, display)
• Keep file sizes reasonable for web usage
Additional Notes
• If the original screenshot contains branding, try to adapt it appropriately
• Consider the target platform when adjusting dimensions
• Each variation should feel distinctly different while maintaining professional quality
• Include comments in HTML for easy customization later
