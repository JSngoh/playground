# Ad Generation Workflow

## Goal
Create high-converting ads using screenshot as design inspiration.

## Trigger
Screenshot + "generate ads" / "create ads" / "make ads"

## Process

### 1. Read Screenshot Accurately
**Describe what you actually see - don't assume:**
- Text visible in image
- Objects and graphics present  
- Actual colors used
- Typography style
- Overall aesthetic (vintage, modern, bold, minimal)

### 2. Ask Product & Audience
"What product/service should I advertise and who's your main audience?"

### 3. Generate 3 Ad Variations
Use screenshot's visual style with different messaging approaches.

### 4. Auto-Ship
- Create HTML file (1200x630, embedded CSS)
- Push to repo with PR
- Share PR link

## If No Screenshot
"Upload a design screenshot first."
